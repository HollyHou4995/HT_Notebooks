The only area that I would suggest as potentially needing some attention is the new hire / onboarding process. I'm not sure if this is the realm of EAG's influence, but that has been the only blight on an otherwise exemplary experience.   Specific areas of focus (from my personal experience):
 - Background checks: process was cumbersome, nearly derailed my hire date, and let to me joining the company feeling very off balance. Outsourcing the ""initial contact"" to a company that is neither influenced or motivated by our company culture and objectives seems like a misstep.
 - Long gap between offer letter and first paycheck. I believe it was 6 weeks for me. For most people, that might be a deal breaker that could result in HealthTrust missing out on top talent.
 - Technology accessibility upon hire. It took 3 days for me to get my laptop and another few days to get it working properly. I've heard that I was one of the lucky ones to get it so quickly.  All of these are minor things, but combined to create a feeling of chaos as my first interaction with the company.   

Again, I have loved my experience as part of the HealthTrust family. This is the only area that I can think of that hasn't been incredible."
